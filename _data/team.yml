    Juul obtained a Master's degree in Psychology at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in 2018. 
    After working in our research unit---Work and Organizational Psychology---for several months, he started his PhD, which is funded by FWO (G027519N), entitled "Psychological contracts as complex dynamic networks: Introducing the iPC-networks model" in 2019. 
    His PhD research is supervised by Prof. Tim Vantilborgh. In his research, Juul adopts a new perspective to studying psychological contracts as dynamic networks that model the ongoing exchanges of employer inducements for employee contributions.
