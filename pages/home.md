Welcome to the website of the Dynamic psychological contract lab, which is part of the Work and Organizational Psychology research unit [(click here for the WOPs website)](https://wops.research.vub.be/en/homepagina/) at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](www.vub.ac.be). 

Our lab focuses on studying dynamic processes at the workplace, with a specific emphasis on understanding how psychological contracts are formed, negotiated, changed, and abandoned over time. These psychological contracts are essential to understand employees' behaviors, as they capture an employee's subjective beliefs regarding mutual obligations between the employee and an employer. Fulfilment and breach of these obligations form powerful determinants of employees' behaviors in the workplace.
