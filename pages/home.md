Welcome to the website of the Dynamic workplace phenomena lab, which is part of the Work and Organizational Psychology research unit [(click here for the WOPs website)](https://wops.research.vub.be/en/homepagina/) at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](www.vub.ac.be). 

Our lab focuses on studying dynamic processes at the workplace, such as psychological contracts and burnout. Regarding the former, we examine how psychological contracts are formed, negotiated, changed, and abandoned over time. These psychological contracts are essential to understand employees' behaviors, as they capture an employee's subjective beliefs regarding mutual obligations between the employee and an employer. Fulfilment and breach of these obligations form powerful determinants of employees' behaviors in the workplace. Regarding the latter, we use a dynamic systems perspective to redefine burnout as a network of interacting symptoms. Using this approach, we study how burnout develops over time, which symptoms are ideal targets for treatment, and how early warning signals can help to prevent the onset of burnout.
